# Tron Game

by Alex Lea
May 18, 2024

This is a recreation of the classic game "Tron", borrowed from code written
for the game "Snake" (should be in another of my repositories).

The purpose of this project was to improve upon the structure of the
Snake game and more effectively utilize OOP to control player interactions
easily. As with the Snake game, I gained more experience with HTML/CSS/JS
and became more comfortable with web development and testing.

Feel free to submit issues, give suggestions, or take for personal use.*
